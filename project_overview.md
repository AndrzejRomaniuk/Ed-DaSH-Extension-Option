## Scientific Value and Quality of Training  

The currency of modern health and bioscience is big, complex data: diverse in origin and
format, large in volume, and fluid over time and place. Researchers at all career stages are finding
they require new skills in statistics, data management, and computation to operate successfully in
this rapidly changing environment. Complex data analysis requires a solid command of statistics,
from the fundamentals through to high dimensional statistics and machine learning. Datasets
themselves must be carefully and securely managed throughout their life cycles, both by data
producers and consumers. Computational analysis of large datasets must be portable, scalable
and reproducible, which calls for virtual environments and workflow management systems.
Intersecting these requirements is a move towards open science, exemplified by the [FAIR
principles][fair]{:target="_blank"} (Findable-Accessible-Interoperable-Reproducible). Our proposed training programme
will develop and deliver workshops to disseminate best practices for data science in â€˜omics (here
defined as the analysis of DNA and RNA sequencing, and of subcellular components such as
RNA, proteins and metabolites) with training packages covering statistics, computation, and data
management.
