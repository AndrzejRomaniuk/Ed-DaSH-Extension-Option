## Scientific Value and Quality of Training  

The currency of modern health and bioscience is big, complex data: diverse in origin and
format, large in volume, and fluid over time and place. Researchers at all career stages are finding
they require new skills in statistics, data management, and computation to operate successfully in
this rapidly changing environment. Complex data analysis requires a solid command of statistics,
from the fundamentals through to high dimensional statistics and machine learning. Datasets
themselves must be carefully and securely managed throughout their life cycles, both by data
producers and consumers. Computational analysis of large datasets must be portable, scalable
and reproducible, which calls for virtual environments and workflow management systems.
Intersecting these requirements is a move towards open science, exemplified by the [FAIR
principles][fair]{:target="_blank"} (Findable-Accessible-Interoperable-Reproducible). Our proposed training programme
will develop and deliver workshops to disseminate best practices for data science in ‘omics (here
defined as the analysis of DNA and RNA sequencing, and of subcellular components such as
RNA, proteins and metabolites) with training packages covering statistics, computation, and data
management.  


## Aims

Our aim is to enable researchers at all career stages to harness the power of data-driven
research and innovation for health and bioscience, by providing training in the management and
analysis of biological data. We will address this aim by scaling up our successful and
oversubscribed training programs, by engaging with The Carpentries’ open platform (see below),
adding new curricula, and training new instructors. Our remotely delivered training programme will
be piloted locally and made available nationally, publicized via our strong links to organizations
involved in data science UK-wide. Our team will bring together subject-matter expertise in ’omics,
statistics, and computation, with strengths in research data management and the UK’s largest
Carpentries chapter, to build an extensive cohort of confident practitioners and a scalable and
sustainable network of health and bioscience data science training for the UK.  


## Objectives

1. Develop peer-reviewed training modules for biological data science that address identified skill
gaps in health and bioscience researchers (Statistics; Open science, [FAIR principles][fair]{:target="_blank"} & data
management; Data science computing with workflows) using The Carpentries platform.

2. Deliver 98 days of remote training of our new workshops, plus established introductory material,
to a diverse community of researchers in academia and industry across all career stages.

3. Offer a clinic after every workshop for learners to ask advice regarding their own projects.

4. Train 30 new instructors to deliver these workshops, building a scalable training community.
