# Edinburgh Data Science Training for Healthcare & Biosciences (Ed-DaSH)

## Data driven life science skills development - equipping society for the future

**The motivation: addressing unmet data-skills needs**

Life sciences research, in particular ‘omics technologies needed for analysis of genomes and
cellular components that generate ‘big data’ sets, has moved at an astonishing speed. In just eight
years, the fraction of data-rich science in research grant applications to BBSRC has grown from
20% to over 50%, according to the BBSRC Review Data-Intensive Bioscience (chaired by Prof A
Millar, Nov 2020), which made bioscience data training its Recommendation. This reflects that
many researchers across all career stages continue to feel poorly equipped to analyze, interpret,
manage, visualize, integrate, store, source and share the resulting ‘big data’ sets. This need for
enhanced biosciences data skills was reported in 2015, when the BBSRC and MRC Joint Review
of Vulnerable Skills and Capabilities (updated 2017) identified Mathematics, Statistics and
Computational Biology as priority areas for further investment and development, with data analytics
and bioinformatics especially vulnerable. The NERC Environmental Omics: A Community Vision
report (2019) also highlighted the need for bioinformatics training to maximize the uses of new
genomics technologies to solve major environmental issues. This is not just a UK challenge: A
recent OECD report noted: _“The COVID-19 pandemic ... has underscored the critical importance of
data-intensive science and the need for strategic approaches to strengthening the digital capacity
and skills of the scientific enterprise as a whole._” Demand for digital training far outstrips supply.
