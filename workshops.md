Our workshops will teach a mix of existing and new content, including new material developed
in parallel by other initiatives, to address the skills gaps most frequently identified by health and
bioscience researchers. We will use open-source platforms developed by The Carpentries, a
community-based project that is a global leader in teaching data and coding skills. The Carpentries
paradigm of open access training leads participants on a skills development path, first as a learner,
then helping an experienced instructor, finally leading instruction themselves. The Carpentriesâ€™
success and sustainability is driven by its inclusive and collaborative approach, broadening the
base of people actively engaged in learning, applying, and teaching data skills. It is a financially
sound initiative receiving generous support from major donors (e.g. Chan Zuckerberg Initiative,
Alfred P. Sloan Foundation, Gordon and Betty Moore Foundation, California Digital Library, and
Mozilla Open Source Support Program) and further financed by membership subscriptions. All
workshops will be in Carpentries format, with open-source materials deposited in The Carpentries
Incubator (hosted on GitHub) for sharing, peer review, and archiving. Mr G Peru (Edinburgh
Carpentries [EdCarp], Edinburgh Parallel Computing Centre [EPCC]) will facilitate this process as
Programme Liaison (WP4.1, 4.2).
